"Simsu is a basic Sudoku game. You can switch between filling in notes "
"(pencil mode), or filling in answers (pen mode). To make it easier to see "
"where to place numbers, you can highlight all instances of a number. You can "
"also check your answers for correctness while playing. The game stores your "
"current notes and answers, so that you can pick up where you left off the "
"next time you play."
